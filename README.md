<h1 align="center">pxtrm</h1> <p align="center">A [WIP] pixel art editor
inside the terminal.</p>

pxltrm is written in pure bash and heavily abuses escape sequences to
function. Use a terminal emulator written in the last 20 years or so and
you’ll be fine.

The terminal color palette is used as the drawing palette. Pair pxltrm
with [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) to use palettes
generated from your wallpaper and to change palettes on the fly.

You can easily save and load your work. Each saved “screen” is just a
series of escape sequences. All you need to do to view a screen is to
print the file to the terminal.

<!--Multiple “brushes” are also supported. They’re just characters so you
can draw with pretty much anything you like.-->
